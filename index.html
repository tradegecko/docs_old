      <p>The TradeGecko Platform API is a RESTful web API (RESTful web service) - implemented using HTTP and REST principles. We support the standard HTTP methods (e.g., GET, PUT, POST, or DELETE) and all data is presented in JSON format. The API can be understood by off-the-shelf HTTP clients, and we provide libraries for specific languages.</p>
      <p><blockquote>
        <strong>Disclaimer:</strong>
        The TradeGecko API is currently undergoing development before its official release.
        The software may contain defects or bugs and the primary purpose of this beta testing
        is to obtain customer feedback on software performance and the identification of defects.
       </blockquote>

      For authentication we currently support OAuth 2 - based on version 22 of the OAuth specification. If you are developing on the Ruby on Rails development stack there is an open source omni-auth authentication strategy <a href="https://github.com/tradegecko/omniauth-tradegecko">available here.</a></p>

      <p>We dog-food the TradeGecko API internally as the TradeGecko web application is developed as an Ember.js client-side Javascript application that talks to our REST API (application programming interface).</p>
