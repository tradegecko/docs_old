    <h3>Inventory and Order Management API </h3>
    <p>
    At TradeGecko our entire application is developed as an Ember.js client-side Javascript application that talks to our Ruby on Rails API (application programming interface). Wooooh – mouthful.
    </p>

    <p>
    Whilst that technical jargon won’t mean much to a lot of our customers, what it does mean is that we have an awesome platform that we use internally to develop our application on top of, and soon we’re going to be releasing access to that platform to allow you (or anyone in your team, or that you can find to hire) to develop whatever you like on top of the TradeGecko Open Inventory and Ordering Platform.
    </p>

    <p>
    To give you an idea of what will be possible with the TradeGecko platform; we just recently worked with a couple of our customers to develop an application that enables them to invite their customers into a small online order management app that sits on top of TradeGecko.
